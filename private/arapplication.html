                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>This is the second interaction design project in the Introduction class at IIT Institute of Design (ID).<br>
                    Each student was assigned to design an augumented reality (AR) application which would be run on a window of CTA bus or train.
                </p>
                <p>I made "Time Traveler in Chicago" that gives commuters and tourists opportunities of enjoying, experiencing and learning about the history of Chicago. 
                    The app projects old pictures on a window which were taken at the same location where a bus is running.

                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    There were two problems I would like to solve. First one was how to entertain communters. 
                    From my experience, I assumed that commuters might have gotten bored with the same view from a window of bus or train when they commute. 
                    I tried to give them a new kind of experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second was how to maximize tourists' experiences while they stayed in the city. 
                    Considering when I had visited Chicago for sightseeing, I thought that I may have increased my experience while riding the bus. 
                    That was because a bus would give an oppotunity for tourists to look around the city.
                </p>

                <div class="info-content sketch">
                    <h4>Wireframe</h4>
                    <p>
                        When I made 10 rough ideas at the beginning, most of them were weather forecast apps because it seemed to be interesting to project weather condition on a bus window. 
                        However, when I presented them in a class, my classmates did not understand the necessity to see weather forecast on a window. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, I changed my theme from weather forecast to history which was my last idea of my wireframes. 
                        The idea was inspired by a Japanese popular TV program that went around cities with their old maps to introduce the histories. 
                        I assumed that the idea would be more interesting because I had never seen an AR app projecting historical scenes.
                    </p>

                <h4>Prototype</h4>
                <p>
                    In the 1st prototype created in Principle, after selecting a category and an age, users can see a past object from an old photo mixed in the current view. 
                    When users tap the object, they can see the photo information that where it was taken and who took it. 
                    However, when I demonstrated in the class, I got feedback that it was weird and confusing that a past photo and a current view existed together.

                <p>
                    In the 2nd prototype, I changed an age selection screen from a circle style to a bar style because time sequence is linear. 
                    I made a split line to change a past photo and a current view inspired by <a href="https://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/" target="_blank">Kaleidoscope</a> 
                    and <a href="https://codepen.io/tutsplus/pen/bWKMoK" target="_blank">Split-Screen UI</a> to help users to distinguish them more easily. 
                    Additionally, the animation of time travel was made to make user experience newer, more stylish and more entertaining.

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    The final version became consisted with circle shaped designs such as a clock, a lens and the time travel animation based on feedback for the 2nd prototype. 
                    I added a function to capture a view to make the app more feasible when users use it in a moving bus. 
                    Also, a category selection screen was changed to a filter to simplify the user experience. 
                    From an educational point of view, I added more detail infomation of an old object.
